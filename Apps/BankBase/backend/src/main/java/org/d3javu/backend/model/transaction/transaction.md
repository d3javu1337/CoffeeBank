types of bank transaction:
1. money transfer between bank client (transfers like by phone numbers, card numbers)
2. payment in stores and etc. 
3. withdraw and replenish operations (seems like )

about transactions:
it should have at least sender id and recipient id, money also
info like transaction details should be like sender name and recipient name 

we wanna show users info about transactions in less view like only name of other client and money, and 
only if user want some details, he can get the cheque of transaction which will be generated by bank core
or other service
